    ## Description

     The README generator was designed to create well designed and informative ReadMe's for future repositories. It enables me to create a ReadMe with a standard layout and include all of the necessary information about the repository. Through the creation of this repository, I have learned how to create functionality in the ReadMe as well as practice my node skills- including fs.writefile.
